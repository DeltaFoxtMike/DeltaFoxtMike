## Quick facts

🔫 Secretly I would like to work on a military project.

😑 I like math, even if the school system in Italy manages to make everyone hate it.

👯‍♂️ I work with a group of guys, together we have created a company called **Aronky Development!**

🛫 I love aviation and would like to take the [Private Pilot License (PPL)](https://atpflightschool.com/become-a-pilot/flight-training/private-pilot-license.html)!

🚗 I often listen to [Phonk](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWWY64wDtewQt) music, it should be more popular!

🤖 Artificial Intelligence fascinates me, I would like to do some projects, but it requires a lot of effort.
