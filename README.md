## About me

I am a high school student in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), I am interested in Web Design but also in programming with C and its derivatives, I also do automatic [Forex Trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market) with Bots scripted in [MQL4](https://docs.mql4.com).

On this profile I will post all the exercises we do at school (they are ✨ very simple ✨) and also my personal projects.
