## About me 🧐 

### 🏆 Finalist in the [Italian Robotics Olympics 2022](https://www.olimpiadirobotica.it) (Together with [IsTk0](https://github.com/IsTk0)) 🏆
I'm a high school student in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), initially I worked a lot on [Web Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design), but now I've (happily) moved to [Compiled Math Languages](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/best-programming-languages-for-math/), even if for a lot of projects I use my beloved [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook).
I work daily on multiple projects involving [Robotic Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics), [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and [Experimental Healthcare](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/experimental-medicine/#:~:text=Experimental%20medicine%20is%20a%20broad,of%20new%20discoveries%20or%20treatments.).

As you may have noticed I am also very interested in [General Aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_aviation) and in fact I am getting my [Private Pilot License (PPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_pilot_licence). I am also very interested in [Algorithmic Trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading) of [CFDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_for_difference) and [Real Estate Investments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investing).

## Quick facts 💣

🔫 Secretly I would like to work on a [military project](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgustaWestland_AW129).

😑 I like math, even if the school system in Italy manages to make everyone hate it.

👯‍♂️ I created together with [IsTk0](https://github.com/istk0) [(visit his site)](https://istk0.github.io/) a company called **[Aronky Technologies](https://github.com/AronkyTechnologies)**!

🛫 I love aviation and would like to take the [Private Pilot License (PPL)](https://atpflightschool.com/become-a-pilot/flight-training/private-pilot-license.html)!

🚗 I often listen to [Phonk](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWWY64wDtewQt) music, it should be more popular!

🤖 Artificial Intelligence fascinates me, I would like to do some projects, but it requires a lot of effort.
