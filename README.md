## About me

I am a high school student in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), I am interested in Web Design but also in programming with C and its derivatives, I also do automatic [Forex Trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market) with Bots scripted in [MQL4](https://docs.mql4.com).

On this profile I will post all the exercises we do at school (they are ✨ very simple ✨) and also my personal projects.

## Quick facts

🔫 Secretly I would like to work on a military project.

😑 I like math, even if the school system in Italy manages to make everyone hate it.

👯‍♂️ I work with a group of guys, together we have created a company called **Aronky Development!**

🛫 I love aviation and would like to take the [Private Pilot License (PPL)](https://atpflightschool.com/become-a-pilot/flight-training/private-pilot-license.html)!

🚗 I often listen to [Phonk](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWWY64wDtewQt) music, it should be more popular!

🤖 Artificial Intelligence fascinates me, I would like to do some projects, but it requires a lot of effort.
